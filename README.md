# Passw-Coder

I store my pasword(and maybe emails|usernames) in a TXT file and I keep it in a USB drive and I was thinking that this is not a __secure__ way to do it so I programmed my first C++ program and it was a simple coder(and also decoder) for my TXT files.

## to use it:
* compile it --> `g++ app.cpp`
* run it --> `./a.out`
